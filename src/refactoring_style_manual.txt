Style manual for Pindel refactoring
by Eric-Wubbo Lameijer and Kai Ye
Version 0.0, August 31st 2011

If you refactor:

General guidelines for writing new classes and functions:
-try keep as many data members as possible private
-add your name and the date to any new function or class you make


Layout:

if ( ) {
	line1;
	line2;
}
else {
	line3;
}

for/while/do:

for () {
	line1;
	line2;
}

Variable names/ function names/ class names.

We use camelCase

Variable names start with lower case character:
variableName

Function and classn names start with upper case character:
FunctionName
ClassName

If a variable is global, prefix g_
g_globalVariable;

If a variable is local/private to a class, prefix m_ (member)

m_memberVariable

Variables local to a function just have a regular name
variableName
