pindel 0.2.4o, March 9 2012
1. Matthijs: what: added delete to destructor in OutputSorter.cpp. Why: small memory leak in 0.2.4n (string allocated in constructor was never deallocated)
2. Eric-Wubbo: what: made separate procedure for reading LI headers in getSampleNamesAndChromosomes in pindel2vcf. Why: no long insertions were reported by pindel2vcf0.2.7, because chromosome was skipped as we tried to save runtime by skipping chromosomes without SV-calls, but pindel2vcf0.2.7 did not correctly find the chromosomes of long insertions due to LI headers having a different format than other Pindel output files.
3. Kai: what: added sample name and read name to LI/BP output. Why: user request
4. Eric-Wubbo: what: changed two bugs in the reporting of short inversions: they were erroneously indicated as 'D', and the inverted region was displayed several times (so 5x if it was 5 bases long, making a '25-base' inversion instead of a 5 one). Why: user notified us of small inversions being miscalled as deletions, manual inspection also revealed the other bug.
5. Kai: what: changed quality check (MAX_ALLOWED_MISMATCHES now float). Is slightly less sensitive when using default parameters, but speed improves. Why: in response to reports that newer versions of pindel were considering many more reads than old versions even while the number of SV-calls stayed almost the same.
